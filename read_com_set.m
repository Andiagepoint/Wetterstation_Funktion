function [ request_value ] = read_com_set( device_id, request_list )
%This function reads the communication settings 
%E.g. read_com_set('03',{city_id})
%
%   device_id  has to be '03'
%
%   To get the index for the actual weather region setup 
%   request_list has to be {'city_id'}
%
%   To get the connection quality request_list has to be {'quality'}
%
%   To get the transmitting station id from which data are received set
%   request_list {'transmitting_station'}
%
%   To get more data with a single function call just build a cell array for
%   the request_list with the interested objects like {'city_id','quality'}
%   The results are sorted in the way the request_list was grouped.

% Decide if more than one communication settings are requested
if size(request_list,2) > 1
% Progress bar to show processing time
    wb = waitbar(0,'Please wait while reading registers...');

% Send request for each list element 
    for t = 1:size(request_list,2)
        waitbar(t/size(request_list,2))
% Get register address from struct
        [reg_address, field_name] = get_reg_address(request_list{t});

% Generate modbus message 'rr' indicates a read register operation
        modbus_msg = gen_msg(device_id, reg_address, reg_num, 'rr');
% Send message and evaluate the response
        request_value(t) = send_and_receive_data(modbus_msg, field_name, '', '', '', '');
